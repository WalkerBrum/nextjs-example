        I work in the Production Engineering area in the industrial sector, planning and controlling the entire production chain, from the arrival of raw material to the transformation into a finished product, checking the efficiency of processes in order to reduce waste as much as possible. I am also responsible for controlling raw material and finished product inventories, realizing periodic conferences, as well as organizing them in order to facilitate distribution to the production and shipping center. I cover knowledge in Lean Six Sigma, Black Belt Methodology.
